## TheBunnyMan123's dotfiles
### Installation
To install along with the packages in my workflow, run:
`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBunnyMan123/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash`

If you wish to install without packages, run:
(doing this will assume you install my bunny-prompt project)
`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBunnyMan123/dotfiles/master/install_nopkg.sh | bash`
